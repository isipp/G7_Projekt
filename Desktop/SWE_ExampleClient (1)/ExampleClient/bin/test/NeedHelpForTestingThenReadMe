You can find the tutorial slides on unit testing on Moodle.
Further there is an example project covering jUnit5 in depth showing you how to write unit tests available on Moodle 
in Moodle. Also a Unit Testing tutorial will be given.
Note, the gradle configuration of this project is already configured correctly so that you can start writing
unit tests with jUnit5 (recommended) without any need to adapt the given gradle configuration. 
I would recommend that you add the tests in this folder (respect separation of responsibility while doing so, i.e.,
create multiple packages, classes, and so on to store the unit tests).
