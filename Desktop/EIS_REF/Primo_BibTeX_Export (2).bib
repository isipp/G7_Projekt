abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe multiple case studies based on free open-source software (F OSS) web applications. F OSS web applications were deployed to create a demo web-portal for Swiss small- and medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs). The web-portal will demonstrate web applications for the purpose of F OSS awareness and their subsequent trials.Design methodology approach - Multiple case studies using rapid prototyping methods to deploy F OSS web applications were used.Findings - It was found that a web-portal for increasing awareness and enabling interactive trials in the context of web applications suited to service organisations such as the SMTEs would enable further investigation regarding F OSS adoption in the SMTE community.Research limitations implications - Major components deployed in developing a web-portal provide a limited set of trials and do not represent the wide range of F OSS applications which might be applicable to the SMTE community.Originality value - F OSS applications, especially web-based business applications, are increasingly being adopted for commercial purposes. However, building awareness and enabling exploration of such applications in the context of SMTEs is still a rare occurrence.},
