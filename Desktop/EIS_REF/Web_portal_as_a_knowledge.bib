   abstract = {This chapter gives a brief introduction to Knowledge Management (KM) and its components, emphasizing the role Social Networks (SNs) can play on KM. The authors will delineate the benefits of collaboration between the concept of Social Networking and the process of KM. With the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, it is a natural evolutionary outcome that SNs have driven the advancement of KM, and conversely KM has driven the advancement of SNs. In certain instances, SNs and KM have a symbiotic relationship whereby one cannot exist without the other. Moreover, an impact analysis will be performed to show that while SNs are an outcome of KM, both require each other in order to succeed where Social Software fits. This chapter is particularly intended to cater to the needs of librarians in a corporate environment and to show the impact and benefits of SNs and KM in the information world.},

   abstract = {Climate change and other drivers are affecting ecosystems around the globe. In order to enable a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to environmental change, a broad range of information, including in-situ observations of both biotic and abiotic parameters, needs to be considered. Access to sufficient and well documented in-situ data from long term observations is therefore one of the key requirements for modelling and assessing the effects of global change on ecosystems. Usually, such data is generated by multiple providers; often not openly available and with improper documentation. In this regard, metadata plays an important role in aiding the findability, accessibility and reusability of data as well as enabling reproducibility of the results leading to management decisions. This metadata needs to include information on the observation location and the research context. For this purpose we developed the Dynamic Ecological Information Management System – Site and Dataset Registry (DEIMS-SDR), a research and monitoring site registry (https://www.deims.org/) that not only makes it possible to describe in-situ observation or experimentation sites, generating persistent, unique and resolvable identifiers for each site, but also to document associated data linked to each site. This article describes the system architecture and illustrates the linkage of contextual information to observational data. The aim of DEIMS-SDR is to be a globally comprehensive site catalogue describing a wide range of sites, providing a wealth of information, including each site's location, ecosystems, facilities, measured parameters and research themes and enabling that standardised information to be openly available.},

   abstract = {Phyre2 is a suite of tools available on the web to predict and analyze protein structure, function and mutations. The focus of Phyre2 is to provide biologists with a simple and intuitive interface to state-of-the-art protein bioinformatics tools. Phyre2 replaces Phyre, the original version of the server for which we previously published a paper in Nature Protocols. In this updated protocol, we describe Phyre2, which uses advanced remote homology detection methods to build 3D models, predict ligand binding sites and analyze the effect of amino acid variants (e.g., nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)) for a user's protein sequence. Users are guided through results by a simple interface at a level of detail they determine. This protocol will guide users from submitting a protein sequence to interpreting the secondary and tertiary structure of their models, their domain composition and model quality. A range of additional available tools is described to find a protein structure in a genome, to submit large number of sequences at once and to automatically run weekly searches for proteins that are difficult to model. The server is available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2. A typical structure prediction will be returned between 30 min and 2 h after submission.},

   abstract = {The web portal technology by Nigerian universities was adopted as a way to help curb one of the burdens of university’s principal managerial operations: “students’ academic management”. This study evaluates usability or "ease of use" of University of Benin (UNIBEN) web portal from the students’ holistic view through the four usability constructs (interface and information quality, system usefulness and overall satisfaction) of the developed Web Portal Usability Success (WEBPUS) Model. It  revealed that the informative features and usefulness of the web portal system has not encouraged students’ usability behaviour due to the portal’s inefficiencies to effectively  and satisfactorily achieve a range of specified or completed tasks irrespective of their competences in basic computer and internet capabilities.http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/njt.v33i2.9},

   abstract = {Current e-Health portal platforms provide support for patients only if they have previously registered and received service from a healthcare facility (e.g., hospital, healthcare clinic, etc.). These portals are usually connected to a central EMR/EHR system linked to a central system. Furthermore, these portals are restrictive in that they are only accessible by these patients at the exclusion of parents, relatives and others that participate in providing care to the patient. Further complications include the increasing demand from our healthcare systems for patients to receive more off-site, non-primary, in-homecare, and/or specialized healthcare services at home (e.g., therapy, nursing, personal support, etc.). Lastly, an increasing number of people would like to have more autonomy over their health in terms of increased access to their own medical records and the services they receive. In this work, we addressed these limitations by creating MyHealthPortal-a patient portal aimed at non-primary care, in-homecare, and/or special healthcare for patients. MyHealthPortal can assist homecare and clinic-based healthcare services along with the benefits of existing portals (e.g., online appointment scheduling, monitoring, and information sharing). MyHealthPortal is secure, robust, flexible and user-friendly. We developed it in partnership with our industry partner, Closing the Gap Healthcare. Closing the Gap is a prominent homecare and clinic-based healthcare service provider that became the first homecare agency to score 100% on standards from accred-itation Canada and was awarded the exemplary standing. In this paper we present MyHealthPortal, the architectural framework that we designed and developed to support the system, and the results of a usability study conducted from real field studies. Our system was tested in a variety of conditions and achieved SUS usability scores of 92.5% (high).},
